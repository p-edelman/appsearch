<h1>About</h1>
<p>This app is meant to launch other apps by typing (part of) their name. It is similar to what the Google universal search widget provides (but limited to apps), but much faster.</p>
<p>This app is written as an "itch to scratch"; on my PC, I'm used to start applications by Gnome Do, Launchy or similar apps. The Google search bar on Android is also able to launch apps, but often waits for ~10 seconds before providing results. This app provides results right away (or almost).</p>
<p>This project is basically done; I don't intend to add much to it or provide frequent updates. For those interested, the source code is available under terms of the GPLv3.</p>
